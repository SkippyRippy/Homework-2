                Once I was older I obtained a deeper understanding of art and its place in the world. I soon realized that I wasn't meant to me a fine arts artist.
                I never wanted to invest all of my time into one medium. So I learned more and more subjects which eventually lead me to coding.

                <p class="para2">i just want this to work please. Just look at my cat. She is Jellybean and this picture is a result of an unknown phenomenon.
                Neither I nor my teacher understand how you can see through my cat's ears in this picture. It is beyond us.
